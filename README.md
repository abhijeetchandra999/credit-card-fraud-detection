# 🔍 Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It involves **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **model building** to classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **legitimate**.  
The insights can help financial institutions reduce risk and prevent losses.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze patterns in credit card transaction data.
- Identify the most important features influencing fraud detection.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions.
- Minimize false negatives (missed fraud cases) while maintaining low false positives.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and log transformations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing transaction patterns and class imbalance.
- **Model Development**: Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and other models.
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
- **Visualization**: Fraud vs Non-Fraud distribution, correlation heatmaps, and feature importance.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data analysis and visualization
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised learning algorithms for classification
